            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>This project's final product was a web app for an organization to use in order to manage their payroll changes. </li>
              <li>I spoke to various stakholders, organized the specifications, and created a product roadmap for this project. </li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>This organization had a payroll system that required the approval of several different departments and stakeholders before an employee could be paid.</li>
              <li>Goverment funds and private sponsor funds have different timelines so depending on the expiration of funding, an employee's funding information needed to be manually changed.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>There are three iterations of this roadmap.</li>
              <li>This first two iterations included holidays. Two of the iterations had color coded tassks. One iteration had a progress bar.</li>
              <li>Ultimately, I decided to remove the holidays to reduce confusion on the meeting dates. I also wanted to remove the progress bar so that the document didn't need to be updated over time to be static. I also wanted to color code the tasks to make it easier to identify the  phases of the project.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>When more than a handful of stakeholders are involved in the development of a new product or service, it is often difficult to focus on a single topic or goal. </li>
              <li>Some people need to see projects from a long term perspective while others can only see single tasks at a time so a roadmap or timeline can be very usefull. </li>

            <h4 style="color:#0b36ff;"><u><a href="https://www.labster.com/simulations" target="_blank">Virtual Lab Simulations</a></u></h4>
            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools and workplaces had to quickly find solutions to provide virtual alternatives to the services that are normally offered. </li>
              <li>I managed the procurement and implementation of an entirely virtual option for lab courses for biology students at a large university. </li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>Lab courses typically require hands on activities to teach students how to use lab equipment and perform experiments, however hands on activities were difficult to provide in a virtual setting.</li>
              <li>There were concerns that students would have to purchase individual subscription plans that would be costly. </li>
              <li>Some prosepctive vendors required students to create accounts to be stored in a server that was not secure or could not be reached by instructors.  </li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>There are several well-known companies and organizations that could potentially provide virtual lab simulations. However, there was only one that could be integrated into the already existing learning management system (LMS).</li>
              <li>Labs provided by a company called Labster were selected due to the ease of the subscription plan, compatibility with existing LMS, and offerings in subjects.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>Online education has never been more easily accessible than now. </li>
              <li>Virtual options for online education have shown to be as effective as traditional education, depending on the student or target audience participating. </li>

            <h4 style="color:#0b36ff;"><u><a href="https://biology.gsu.edu/" target="_blank">Department Website</a></u></h4>
            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>I moved a department’s website to an entirely new and modern platform via Wordpress. </li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>The department’s website was outdated. </li>
              <li>Content and information on the website were difficult to find.</li>
              <li>The information found on the website was wrong or inaccurate.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>I went through 400+ existing web pages and organized them into categories for different audiences in order to create a site plan. </li> 
              <li>I condensed the number of existing web pages to less than a quarter of what it once was by consolidating the information found on the original web pages.</li>
              <li>I moved all of the content into entirely new web pages on an entirely new platform.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>Individual stakeholders will always think that their priorities are the most important for the organization. </li>
              <li>End users who are used to old technologies or systems will always compare new products to what used to exist. </li>

            <h3>Systems Studies</h3>
            
            <h4 style="color:#0b36ff;"><u><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TRASoR_DiHJDD_sQZrqYu7Sll9OWKL6yHMox_MQbj7w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Root Cause Analysis</a></u></h4>
            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> This project was an assignment for a learning technologies course. The assignment was to create a root cause analysis (RCA) for a scenario that could happen in the workplace. </li>
              <li> An RCA is a tool that is used to identify the underlying problem that results in an undesired performance. </li>
              <li> I took a real work scenario that I experienced and investigated ways of preventing the possible issues.</li>
           </dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li>The work scenario I chose was an invoicing issue.</li> 
              <li>The vendor had not been paid for the services or products that they provided several months prior.</li>
            </dd>
             <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> I used four methodologies to identify the problems. </li>
              <li> First, I created a fish bone diagram, a consulting method whereby consultants come in to identify all the possible causes of a problem. The fish bone diagram assists in assessment of a situation when very little information is known. </li>
              <li> Second, I created an intervention logic, which shows the actions required in a workflow to reach a target or create a product. </li>
              <li> Third, I used a school district’s model for interventions, which shows how interventions are cycles, rather than linear one-time fixes. </li>
              <li> Finally, I used a level based model for implementation plans, created by a federal agency, to develop an implementation plan for my solutions. In this model, issues come from varying levels of authority or environments, which can all be addressed individually. </li></dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> Assessing situations can be difficult, especially if you don’t know anything about the people or tasks involved. This is where a needs assessment is useful. </li>
              <li> A needs assessment is can take about as much time as the development of the product or service. </li>
              <li> A single change in a workflow can drastically improve the resulting conditions or productsm which ultimately impacts change management.</li>

            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> This project is a game that I created using a service called Scratch.</li>
              <li> Scratch enables users to learn about computer science algorithms with a computer program being the final product. </li>
              <li> My game requires game players to get the soccer player character to the goal while also avoiding the dangerous virus. </li>
              <li> Note: This product is not suitable for mobile devices.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> I wanted to make sure that the game player could not get to the goal in a simple straight line. </li>
              <li> I wanted to enable the virus to penalize the game player. </li>
              <li> I also wanted to incorporate loops where, for the entirety of the game, if the game player caused a certain event to happen, then it would force the game player to start over.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> To require the game player to maneuver through the game rather than moving in a straight line, I set up a game map. </li>
              <li> The player must use their keyboard arrow keys to move the game character through the game map. </li>
              <li> If the game player ever encountered the virus, then the death counter would increase. </li>
              <li> The playable area within the game map had boundaries. If the game player ever crossed the boundary lines, then they would have to start over at the starting point. </li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> Computer science algorithms are just a series of user inputted requests. </li>
              <li> If you enter something into the computer to ask for a response, then the computer will provide a response. </li>
              <li> Scratch is one of many popular technologies used to teach students about the maker movement and the logic of computer science algorithms.</li>

            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> The lesson plan needed to have objectives, cover Georgia Science Teaching standards, activities that incorporated use of technology, and a final assessment.</li>

            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>

            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> Learning theories incorporated into the lesson plan are Gagne’s events of instruction and Bloom’s taxonomy. </li>
              <li> The items planned for each day exist so that the learner experiences all nine events of Gagne’s events of instruction. </li>
              <li> The objectives and activity instructions are written according to Bloom’s taxonomy.</li>
              <li> Technology used in the lesson plan included but are not limited to Parlay, Google Classroom, and Google Jamboard. </li>

            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> This project was an assignment for a design research course. I created a presentation to go along with a guided discussion that I led in a small class.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> There are many fields of academia that are considered design research. The problem is that there are many terms for the same concepts for all of the fields in question.</li>
              <li> I needed to make my presentation interactive, while also presenting the content. </li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> In this presentation, I present a framework for design research that is applicable to all fields in question. </li>
              <li> The presentation includes interactive activities throughout the duration of the presentation and a final discussion activity in the end. </li>
              <li> This presentation is only meant to be a tool to go along with a discussion style lecture on the topic. </li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> When presenting to audiences, make sure to not rely on the presentation. The presentation should only aid in what the presenter is saying. xt</li>
              <li> Presentation slides should not have too much information, only the key concepts.</li>

            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> The short movie needed to have a story, a soundtrack, visuals, and credits.</li>

            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> I wrote the script based on a scary story that I read off of the internet. I illustrated the visuals. All aspects of the movie were put together by me except for the soundtrack. </li>
              <li> The soundtrack only consists of one song, which is credited in the credits. The song did not require a license to use.</li>
            </dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> Short stories were the original way that humans passed on knowledge to one another. Movies help the audience see and imagine the events in stories. </li>
              <li> To communicate stories, content creators write and create tools to share information through the use of storytelling.</li>

            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>
              <li> The header texts of each section were strategically capitalized in order to indicate the target audience. </li>
