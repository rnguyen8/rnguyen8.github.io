          <h3>Project Description
          </h3>
          <p>This project was an assignment for a Learning Technologies course. The assignment was to create a root cause analysis (RCA) for a work scenario. An RCA is a tool that is used to find the underlying problem that results in an undesired performance. I took a real work experience and looked into ways of preventing the issues that I experienced.
          </p>
          <h3>Problems
          </h3>
          <p>The work scenario I chose was an invoicing issue. The vendor had not been paid for the services or products that they provided.
          </p>
          <h3>Solutions
          </h3>
          <p>I used four methodologies to identify the problems. First, I created a fish bone diagram, which is a consulting method, whereby consultants come in to identify all of the possible causes of a problem. It assists in accessing a situation when very little is known. Second, I used an intervention logic, which explains that the desires receivables aren’t necessarily the direct product of particular actions in a workflow. Third, I used a school district’s model for interventions, which shows how interventions are cycles rather than linear one-time fixes. Finally, I used a model for implementation plans, created by a federal agency, to develop an implementation plan for my solutions.
          </p>   
          <h3>Takeaways
          </h3>
          <p>Accessing situations can be difficult, especially if you don’t know anything about the people or tasks involved. A needs assessment is always necessary when starting a new consulting project. There can be several levels to issues. The once I identified are: procedural, programmatic, systematic, and external. All of the levels can affect the result of a workflow.

          <h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/384392344/" target="_blank">*Scratch</a>
          </h2>
          <h3>Project Description
          </h3>
          <p>This project is a game that I created using a service called Scratch. Scratch enables users to learn about computer science algorithms with a program being the final product. My game requires game players to get the soccer player character to the goal while also avoiding the dangerous virus. Note: This product is not suitable for mobile devices.
          </p>
          <h3>Problems
          </h3>
          <p>I wanted to make sure that the game player couldn’t get to the goal in a simple straight line. I wanted to enable the virus to penalize the game player. I also wanted to incorporate loops where, for the entirety of the game, if the game player caused a certain event to happen, then it would force the game player to start over.
          </p>
          <h3>Solutions
          </h3>
          <p>To require the game player to maneuver through the game rather than moving in a straight line, I set up a game map. The player must use their keyboard arrow keys in order to move the game character through the game map. If the game player ever encountered the virus, then the death counter would increase. The playable area within the game map had boundaries. If the game player ever crossed the boundary lines, then they would have to start over at the starting point.
          </p>   
          <h2>Takeaways
          </h3>
          <p>Computer science algorithms are just a series of user inputted requests. If you enter something into the computer, it will provide a response.

          </h2>
          <h3>Project Description
          </h3>
          <p>This project was as assignment for a learning technologies course. The assignment was to create a lesson plan for a short “mini-unit” for a topic of my choice. I used my background in virology to create learning objectives, activities, and assessments.
          </p>
          <h3>Problems
          </h3>
          <p>The lesson plan needed to have objectives, cover Georgia Science Teaching standards, activities that incorporated use of technology, and a final assessment.
          </p>
          <h3>Solutions
          </h3>
          <p>All solutions (learning objectives, Georgia Science Teaching standards, activities, and assessments) are listed on the respective day’s lesson cover page.
          </p>   
          <h3>Takeaways
          </h3>
          <p>Learning theories incorporated into the lesson plan are Gagne’s events of instruction and Bloom’s taxonomy. The items planned for each day exist so that the learner experiences all nine events of Gagne’s events of instruction. The objectives and activity instructions are written according to Bloom’s taxonomy. Technology used in the lesson plan included but are not limited to Parlay, Google Classroom, and Google Jamboard.

          </h2>
          <h3>Project Description
          </h3>
          <p>This project was an assignment for a design research course. I created presentation to go along with a guided discussion that I led. 
          </p>
          <h3>Problems
          </h3>
          <p>There are many fields of academia that are considered design research. The problem is that there are many terms for the same concepts for all of the fields in question. 
          </p>
          <h3>Solutions
          </h3>
          <p>In this presentation, I present a framework for design research that is applicable to all fields in question. The presentation includes an interactive activity throughout and a final discussion activity in the end. This presentation is only meant to be a tool to along with a discussion style lecture on the topic. 
          </p>   
          <h3>Takeaways
          </h3>
          <p>When presenting to audiences, make sure to not rely on the presentation. The presentation should only aid in what the presenter is saying. Presentation slides shouldn't have too much information, only the key concepts.

          <h3>Project Description
          </h3>
          <p>This project was an assignment for a Learning Technologies course. The project is a short movie that I created.
          </p>
          <h3>Problems
          </h3>
          <p>The short movie needed to have a story, a soundtrack, visuals, and credits.
          </p>
          <h3>Solutions
          </h3>
          <p>I wrote the script based on a scary story that I heard. I illustrated the visuals. All aspects of the movie were put together by me except for the soundtrack. The soundtrack only consists of one song, which is credited in the credits. The song did not require a license to use.
          </p>   
          <h3>Takeaways
          </h3>
          <p>Short stories were the original way that humans passed on knowledge to one another. Movies help the audience see and imagine the events of stories. To communicate stories, content creators write and create tools to share information.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <h3>Project Description
          </h3>
          <p>This project was a product that I created during my time working at Georgia State University. The department needed a way to communicate information on various enrollment issues to students.
          </p>
          <h3>Problems
          </h3>
          <p>Students had a number of issues that they needed assistance with, ranging from academic advisement, financial aid, and human resources. The department was short on staff and many staff were working remotely.
          </p>
          <h3>Solutions
          </h3>
          <p>I created a poster with QR codes that lead to helpful websites. The QR codes on the poster are organized by target audience. I ordered posters and signs with my design.
          </p>   
          <h3>Takeaways
          </h3>
          <p>The header texts of each section were strategically capitalized in order to indicate the target audience. The color of the text is white to complement the background color of the headers.

          </h2>
          <h3>Project Description
          </h3>
          <p>This project was a product that I created during my time working at Georgia State University. It is a series of posters for a graduate program.
          </p>
          <h3>Problems
          </h3>
          <p>The department’s graduate program had nothing to share at recruitment events and had trouble getting interests from potential students.
          </p>
          <h3>Solutions
          </h3>
          <p>I created a series of posters providing some information about a graduate program. The font is easy to read. The colors complement each other. The excerpts are short enough to read within a few minutes.
          </p>   
          <h3>Takeaways
          </h3>
          <p>When trying to capture someone’s attention, you often have less than a minute. Your message needs to be short, simple, and unique.
