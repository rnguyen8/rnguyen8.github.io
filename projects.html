            <h3>Systems Analysis</h3>
            
            <h4 style="color:#0b36ff;"><u><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TRASoR_DiHJDD_sQZrqYu7Sll9OWKL6yHMox_MQbj7w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Root Cause Analysis</a></u></h4>
            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>This project was an assignment for a learning technologies course. The assignment was to create a root cause analysis (RCA) for a scenario that could happen in the workplace. An RCA is a tool that is used to identify the underlying problem that results in an undesired performance. I took a real work scenario that I experienced and investigated ways of preventing the possible issues.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>The work scenario I chose was an invoicing issue. The vendor had not been paid for the services or products that they provided several months prior.</dd>
             <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>I used four methodologies to identify the problems. First, I created a fish bone diagram, a consulting method whereby consultants come in to identify all of the possible causes of a problem. The fish bone diagram assists in assessment of a situation when very little is known. Second, I created an intervention logic, which shows the actions required in a workflow to reach a target or create a product. Third, I used a school district’s model for interventions, which shows how interventions are cycles rather than linear one-time fixes. Finally, I used a level wise model for implementation plans, created by a federal agency, to develop an implementation plan for my solutions. In this model, issues come from varying levels of authority or environments, which can all be addressed individually. </dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>Assessing situations can be difficult, especially if you don’t know anything about the people or tasks involved. This is where a needs assessment is useful. A needs assessment is always necessary when starting a new consulting project. There can be several levels to issues. A single change in a workflow can drastically improve the resulting conditions or products.</dd>

            <h4 style="color:#0b36ff;"><u><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/384392344/" target="_blank">Scratch</a></u></h4>
            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>This project is a game that I created using a service called Scratch. Scratch enables users to learn about computer science algorithms with a computer program being the final product. My game requires game players to get the soccer player character to the goal while also avoiding the dangerous virus. Note: This product is not suitable for mobile devices.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>I wanted to make sure that the game player could not get to the goal in a simple straight line. I wanted to enable the virus to penalize the game player. I also wanted to incorporate loops where, for the entirety of the game, if the game player caused a certain event to happen, then it would force the game player to start over.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>To require the game player to maneuver through the game rather than moving in a straight line, I set up a game map. The player must use their keyboard arrow keys to move the game character through the game map. If the game player ever encountered the virus, then the death counter would increase. The playable area within the game map had boundaries. If the game player ever crossed the boundary lines, then they would have to start over at the starting point.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>Computer science algorithms are just a series of user inputted requests. If you enter something into the computer, the computer will provide a response. Scratch is one of many popular technologies used to teach students about the maker movement and the logic of computer algorithms. </dd>

            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>This project was as assignment for a learning technologies course. The assignment was to create a lesson plan for a short “mini-unit” for a topic of my choice. I used my background in virology to create learning objectives, activities, and assessments.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>The lesson plan needed to have objectives, cover Georgia Science Teaching standards, activities that incorporated use of technology, and a final assessment.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>All learning objectives, Georgia Science Teaching standards, activities, and assessments are listed on the respective day’s lesson cover page.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>Learning theories incorporated into the lesson plan are Gagne’s events of instruction and Bloom’s taxonomy. The items planned for each day exist so that the learner experiences all nine events of Gagne’s events of instruction. The objectives and activity instructions are written according to Bloom’s taxonomy. Technology used in the lesson plan included but are not limited to Parlay, Google Classroom, and Google Jamboard.</dd>

            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>This project was an assignment for a design research course. I created a presentation to go along with a guided discussion that I led in a small class.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>There are many fields of academia that are considered design research. The problem is that there are many terms for the same concepts for all of the fields in question.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>In this presentation, I present a framework for design research that is applicable to all fields in question. The presentation includes interactive activities for the duration of the presentation and a final discussion activity in the end. This presentation is only meant to be a tool to go along with a discussion style lecture on the topic.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>When presenting to audiences, make sure to not rely on the presentation. The presentation should only aid in what the presenter is saying. Presentation slides should not have too much information, only the key concepts.</dd>

            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>This project was an assignment for a learning technologies course. The project is a short movie that I created.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>The short movie needed to have a story, a soundtrack, visuals, and credits.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>I wrote the script based on a scary story that I heard. I illustrated the visuals. All aspects of the movie were put together by me except for the soundtrack. The soundtrack only consists of one song, which is credited in the credits. The song did not require a license to use.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>Short stories were the original way that humans passed on knowledge to one another. Movies help the audience see and imagine the events in stories. To communicate stories, content creators write and create tools to share information.</dd>

            <h5><dd>Project Description</dd></h5>
            <dd>This project was a product that I created during my time working at Georgia State University. The department needed a way to communicate information on various enrollment issues to students.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Problems</dd></h5>
            <dd>Students had a number of issues that they needed assistance with, ranging from academic advisement, financial aid, and human resources. The department was short on staff and many staff were working remotely.</dd>
            <h5><dd>Solutions</dd></h5>
            <dd>I created a poster with QR codes that lead to helpful websites. The QR codes on the poster are organized by target audience. My design was printed onto signage placed throughout the school building. </dd>
            <h5><dd>Takeaways</dd></h5>
            <dd>The header texts of each section were strategically capitalized in order to indicate the target audience. The color of the text is white to complement the background color of the headers.</dd>
