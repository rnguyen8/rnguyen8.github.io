            I went through 400+ existing web pages and organized them into categories for different audiences in order to create a site plan.
            I condensed the number of existing web pages to less than a quarter of what it once was by consolidating the information found on the original web pages.
            I moved all of the content into entirely new web pages on an entirely new platform.

            <dd>
            This project is a game that I created using a service called Scratch.
            Scratch enables users to learn about computer science algorithms with a computer program being the final product.
            My game requires game players to get the soccer player character to the goal while also avoiding the dangerous virus.
            Note: This product is not suitable for mobile devices.                
            </dd>
            <h4><dd>Problems</dd></h4>
            <dd>
            I wanted to make sure that the game player could not get to the goal in a simple straight line.
            I wanted to enable the virus to penalize the game player.
            I also wanted to incorporate loops where, for the entirety of the game, if the game player caused a certain event to happen, then it would force the game player to start over.                
            </dd>
            <h4><dd>Solutions</dd></h4>
            <dd>
            To require the game player to maneuver through the game rather than moving in a straight line, I set up a game map.
            The player must use their keyboard arrow keys to move the game character through the game map.
            If the game player ever encountered the virus, then the death counter would increase.
            The playable area within the game map had boundaries. If the game player ever crossed the boundary lines, then they would have to start over at the starting point.

            Computer science algorithms are just a series of user inputted requests.
            If you enter something into the computer to ask for a response, then the computer will provide a response.
            Scratch is one of many popular technologies used to teach students about the maker movement and the logic of computer science algorithms.

            <h4><dd>Description</dd></h4>
            <dd>
            This project was an assignment for a design research course. I created a presentation to go along with a guided discussion that I led in a small class.

            <h4><dd>Problems</dd></h4>
            <dd>
            There are many fields of academia that are considered design research. The problem is that there are many terms for the same concepts for all of the fields in question.
            I needed to make my presentation interactive, while also presenting the content.                
            </dd>
            <h4><dd>Solutions</dd></h4>
            <dd>
            In this presentation, I present a framework for design research that is applicable to all fields in question.
            The presentation includes interactive activities throughout the duration of the presentation and a final discussion activity in the end.
            This presentation is only meant to be a tool to go along with a discussion style lecture on the topic.                
            </dd>
            <h4><dd>Outcomes</dd></h4>
            <dd>
            When presenting to audiences, make sure to not rely on the presentation. The presentation should only aid in what the presenter is saying. xt
            Presentation slides should not have too much information, only the key concepts.

            <dd>
            This project was a product that I created during my time working in an academic department at a large university. The department needed a way to communicate information on various enrollment issues to students.

            <h4><dd>Problems</dd></h4>
            <dd>
            Students had several issues that they needed assistance with, ranging from academic advisement, financial aid, and human resources.
            The department was short on staff and many staff were working remotely.

            <h4><dd>Solutions</dd></h4>
            <dd>
            I created a poster with QR codes that led to helpful websites and provided contact information.
            The QR codes on the poster are organized by target audience.
            My design was printed onto signage placed throughout the school buildings.
            The header texts of each section were strategically capitalized in order to indicate the target audience.
            The color of the text is white to complement the background color of the headers, and provide accessibility for visually impaired audiences.

            The soundtrack only consists of one song, which is credited in the credits. The song did not require a license to use.

                Short stories were the original way that humans passed on knowledge to one another. Movies help the audience see and imagine the events in stories.
            To communicate stories, content creators write and create tools to share information through the use of storytelling.
